# Pascal's Triangle II(Recursion Card) - 119. Pascal's Triangle II
# Difficulty - Easy
# https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/recursion-i/251/scenario-i-recurrence-relation/3234/
# https://leetcode.com/problems/pascals-triangle-ii/


# Given a non-negative index k where k â‰¤ 33, return the kth index row of the Pascal's triangle.

# Note that the row index starts from 0.


# In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

# Example:

# Input: 3
# Output: [1,3,3,1]
# Follow up:

# Could you optimize your algorithm to use only O(k) extra space?
