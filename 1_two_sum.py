# 1. Two Sum - Solved 2/18/2020
# Difficulty: Easy
# https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/
# Description:
# Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
# Example:
# Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
# Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
# return [0, 1].


def twoSum(nums,target):
    num_dict = {}
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        num = nums[i]
        if num in num_dict.keys():
            num_dict[num].append(i)
        else:
            num_dict[num] = [i]

    for i in range(len(nums)):
        curr_num = nums[i]
        complement = target - curr_num
        if complement in num_dict.keys():
            if complement != curr_num:
                return [i, num_dict[complement][0]]
            elif num_dict[complement][0] == i and len(num_dict[complement]) > 1:
                return [i, num_dict[complement][1]]
