# 206. Reverse Linked List - Sovled 4/29-30/2020
# Difficulty - Easy
# https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/

# Description:
# Reverse a singly linked list.

# Example: Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL
# Output: 5->4->3->2->1->NULL
# Follow up:

# A linked list can be reversed either iteratively or recursively. Could you implement both?

# Definition for singly-linked list.


# Solution from thecodingworld youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSs3U18v4xE

# 1 Set previous as None, Current as head, and next as none
# 2 Iterate until current is None
# 3 Set mext mpde pf current to previous
# 4 Set previous as current, current as next and next as it's next node
# 5 set the head pointer to the previous Node

# Same as below but this is all that is needed for leetcode
# In this attempt i created a doubly linked list then made the head and next
